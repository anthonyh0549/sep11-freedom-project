## Review / Sources
As of this week, I have completed my project within terms of planning. I understand the tool to a sufficient extent. As for practice, I have been tinkering with different types of code and overall messing around with my gmail. 

The tool I am using is <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google App Script</a>, which makes use of Google apps such as Docs, Drive, and Gmail and uses a modern JS platform to edit and automate such apps by the user. It does this by connecting to the users' Google account and helps automate the google workspace. 

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a <b>7-step process of planning, designing, creating, testing, and then improving on</b>. In a sense, the process doesn't end as there are always ways to improve upon your design. I'm currently at stage 4, planning on an accessible solution for myself and others to use to keep control and organize their Gmail apps.

I know personally that inbox clutter can be a issue and clean up can be very time consuming. My product is to automate the cleanup and essentially make it more streamline. I have to break down the program into steps and make sure these steps in regards to the scripting follow through well. My first step is organizing, what should be deleted and looked at later. Than after organization, efficiently delete the email threads. Following this thought process I break down the problem into smaller problems and asking smaller questions, so now I have to ask, "How do I organize what needs to be rid of?". 
At the same time, I also don't want to fully automate the cleanup as I want the user to feel in full command of what gets purged and prevent any unintentional loss of important emails. The most important part is creating a program that allows the user to regain control over their inbox. The most important part to me is that the user maintains control over their inbox still. Essentially all I want is for automation for the inbox. 

 

## Knowledge

The Tool I'm using is <b><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google App Scripts</a></b> which a free extension for Google apps that anyone can use to automate apps such as Gmail, Docs, and Sheets. This is done by allowing access and linking them to the popular language JavsScript on a cloud-based platform.

My project is based on organization, though the idea not unique, is very useful. I've noticed that many established programs that follow a similar concept are over-complicated, don't stick to what most people are looking for, and most importantly are costly for a purchase that may or may not work in the way the buyer intends.

Part of the learning process is messing around with the language, reading up on what you can do, and watching. Gauging an understanding of how to manipulate the apps. Also tinkering and seeing what causes what and how different parts interacte with each other, talk with each other. 

## Skills

Skills I learned is how to research and how to study. Knowing what to asorb and how to practice the new found knowlege effectively. Applying what I seen and learned to my own practices.

## Review / Sources


Currently, I'm finializing my project in terms of planning. As for practice I've been watching videos, specifically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgfbl_o9WvM">tutorials</a> for what I could do with my tool and applications for real world situations. 

The tool i'm using, <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google App Script</a>, makes use of Google apps such as Docs, Drive and Gmail and uses a modern JS platform to edit and boost such apps efficiency. There were plentiful of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd3DV_heK2Q">YouTube tutorials</a> on the basics functions of the Google App Script.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a <b>7-step process of planning, designing, creating, testing, and then improving on</b>. In a sense, the process doesn't end as there are always ways to improve upon your design. I'm currently at stage 4, planning on an accessible solution for myself and others to use to keep control and organize their Gmail apps.

To start I have to understand the problem, hard to manage Gmail inboxes. First I have to understand why inboxes are hard to manage, after some <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/02/stop-email-overload-1">research</a> to see what other companies are doing or saying to combat inbox overload. The common trend is for people to try and go through or organize new emails early in the morning or set time aside to do this. As well as organizing emails in categories to make sorting through your inbox easier. Programs such as <a href="https://mailstrom.co/MailStorm">MailStrom</a> does this, categorizing or groups emails and identifies bundles of related mail, and make it easy for you to act on them as a group. Understanding this is important because you wanna clear emails in mass to prevent overflow.
At the same time, I also don't want to fully automate the cleanup as I wanna the user to feel in full control of what gets purged and prevent any unintentional loss of important emails. The most important part is creating a program that allows the user to regain control over their inbox.



 

## Knowledge

The Tool I'm using is <b><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google App Scripts</a></b> which a free extension for Google apps that anyone can use to automate apps such as Gmail, Docs, and Sheets. This is done by allowing access and linking them to the popular language JavsScript on a cloud-based platform.

My project is based on organization, though the idea not unique, is very useful. I've noticed that many established programs that follow a similar concept are over-complicated, don't stick to what most people are looking for, and most importantly are costly for a purchase that may or may not work in the way the buyer intends.

Part of the learning process is messing around with the language, reading up on what you can do, and watching many videos on what to start on to grasp a solid understanding. A great addition to the learning of the tool is that itself offers small tutorials and references to different defined "Functions". Here is a snippet of code from a tutorial the tool offers




 <tt><b>GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body);</tt></b>
 <br>This opens the Gmail app and readys to send a email. 
<br>
<br>
<tt><b>var doc = DocumentApp.create('Hello, world!');</tt></b> 
<br>This opens the Document app <b>Google Docs</b> and writes the following prhase "Hello World". 

This is important as it highlights the interconnectedness bewteen the apps and the tool. Using defined variables to call the apps to commit certain actions such as sending a email or creating a docs. 

## Skills

Skills that I have to use is <b>consideration</b> and <b>Reasoning.</b>

Using the skill of consideration to find ways to work effectively and understand what's being told to me by the videos and the concepts that are being told. Using personal experience which ties to Reasoning I can understand what I have trouble with and what others' main concerns are when concerning with inbox organization. Important things to me when using a new app are being easily accessible and giving the user control, as this is their inbox and when automating such things it's important that it is fine-tuned to what each user would want. The important part is understanding the user and understanding the common problems. Since this is a tool for a personal item, your Gmail inbox, it is important that I don't develop the program in a way that assumes what the user wants.

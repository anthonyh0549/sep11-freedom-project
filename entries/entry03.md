## Review / Sources


Currently, I'm finializing my project in terms of planning. As for practice I've been watching videos, specifically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgfbl_o9WvM">tutorials</a> for what I could do with my tool and applications for real world situations. 

The tool i'm using, <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google App Script</a>, makes use of Google apps such as Docs, Drive and Gmail and uses a modern JS platform to edit and boost such apps efficiency. There were plentiful of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd3DV_heK2Q">YouTube tutorials</a> on the basics functions of the Google App Script.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a <b>7-step process of planning, designing, creating, testing and than improving on</b>. In a sense the process doesn't end as there is always ways to improve upon your design. I'm cuurently at stage 4, planning on a acessble solution for myself and others to use to keep control and organize their Gmail apps. 

To start I have to understand the problem, hard to manage Gmail inboxes. First I have to understand why inboxes are hard to manage, after some <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/02/stop-email-overload-1">research</a> to see what other companies are doing or saying to combat inbox overload. The common trend is for people to try and go through or organize new emails early in the morninng or set time aside to do this. As well as organizing emails in catagroies to make sorting through your inbox easier. Programs such a <a href="https://mailstrom.co/MailStorm">MailStrom</a> does this, catagorizing or groups emails and identifies bundles of related mail and makes it easy for you to act on them as a group. Understanding this is important because you wanna clear emails in mass to prevent overflow. 

At the same time I also don't want to fully automate the cleanup in the as I wanna the user to feel in full control of what gets purged and prevent any unintentional loss of important emails. The most important part is creating a program that allows the user to regain control over their inbox. 

## Knowledge

The <b>Tool</b> I'm using is <b><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google App Scripts</a></b> which a free extension for Google apps that <b>anyone</b> can use to automate apps such as Gmail, Docs, and Sheets. This is done through allowing access and linking them on the popular language JavsScript on a cloud based platform. 

My project is based off organization, though the idea not unique, is very useful. I've noticed that many established programs that follow the similar concept are over-complicated, don't stick to what most people are looking for, and most impotantly are costly for a purchase that may or may not work in the way the buyer intends. 

Part of the learning process is messing around with the langauge, reading up on what you can do, and watching many videos on what to start on to grasp a solid understanding. A great addition to the learning of the tool is that itself offers small tutoirlas and refreneces to different defined "Functions". Here is a snippet of code from a tutoiral the tool offers
